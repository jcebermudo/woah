# Woah

Woah is an open source motion design editor built for people with little to no animation experience. Access to motion design tools shouldn't be locked behind chaotic subscription fees or steep learning curves which is why this project exists. This is just a small project I'm trying to maintain, feel free to contribute/give feedback.
